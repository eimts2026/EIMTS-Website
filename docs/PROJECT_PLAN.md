## 8. DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Development Environment

```
Local Machine
├── /apps/site (npm run dev)
├── /apps/admin (npm run dev)
└── Connected to Supabase staging instance
```

### Production Environment

#### Option A: Separate Vercel Projects (Recommended)

```
Main Site Project
├── Repository: Your git repo
├── Branch: main
├── URL: emerald-isle.lk
├── Deployed from: /apps/site
└── Auto-deploy on push to main

Admin Dashboard Project
├── Repository: Same git repo
├── Branch: main (or separate branch)
├── URL: admin.emerald-isle.lk
├── Deployed from: /apps/admin
└── Auto-deploy on push to main
```

#### Option B: Single Vercel Project (Not recommended)

```
Single Project
├── URL: emerald-isle.lk
├── Routes:
│   ├── / → Main site
│   ├── /admin → Admin dashboard (harder to secure)
└── Deployment: Both apps in one project
```

### Environment Variables (Both Apps)

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxxxx
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=xxxxx (only in admin)
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Git push → Vercel detects → Auto-builds → Auto-deploys
- Failed builds = no deployment
- Easy rollback to previous version

## 13. SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Functional Requirements Met

- ✅ Graphics team can login to admin dashboard
- ✅ Graphics team can upload and publish jobs in <5 minutes
- ✅ Jobs appear live on public site immediately
- ✅ Graphics team can manage popups
- ✅ Popups display correctly on site
- ✅ Job applications save to database

### Non-Functional Requirements Met

- ✅ Real-time sync (changes visible within 5 seconds)
- ✅ 99.9% uptime (Vercel SLA)
- ✅ Secure authentication (no unauthorized access)
- ✅ No conflicts between teams' work

### Team Satisfaction

- ✅ Graphics team finds dashboard intuitive (no training needed)
- ✅ IT team has full control when needed
- ✅ Job posting takes <5 minutes

---

## 14. MAINTENANCE & SUPPORT

### Regular Tasks (Graphics Team)

- Post new jobs when recruitment needs arise
- Update job details if requirements change
- Create/update popups as needed
- Monitor job application count

### Regular Tasks (IT Team)

- Monitor system performance
- Handle database backups (automatic via Supabase)
- Deploy site updates
- Manage user access if needed
- Track analytics

### Troubleshooting

- Failed image upload → Check file size, format
- Slow job posting → Check internet connection
- Jobs not appearing → Check browser cache, refresh
- Contact IT if issues persist

---

## 15. KNOWN CONSTRAINTS & CONSIDERATIONS

1. **Shared Login:** All graphics team members use same credentials (no individual tracking)
   - Solution: Can upgrade to individual logins later if needed

2. **Image Hosting:** Images stored in Supabase (not Hostinger MySQL)
   - Reasoning: Better performance, CDN included, no database bloat

3. **Approval Workflow:** Jobs go live immediately
   - No draft/approval stage (can add later if needed)

4. **Popup Rotation:** Only 1 active popup at a time
   - Rotates between available popups automatically

5. **Admin Dashboard:** Separate from main site
   - Graphics team never touches code or git

---

## 16. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Phase 2+)

- Analytics dashboard (views, applications per job)
- Email notifications (new applications)
- Job scheduling (publish at specific date/time)
- Individual user accounts (instead of shared login)
- Approval workflow (draft → IT approves → publish)
- Job expiration (auto-disable after X days)
- Bulk job import (CSV upload)
- Job templates
- Custom job fields
- Popup analytics

---

## 17. QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION

Before implementation, confirm:

1. ✅ **Shared login** for graphics team? (Yes)
2. ✅ **Single popup** at a time? (Yes)
3. ✅ **Floating center** display for popups? (Yes)
4. ✅ **Immediate publish** without approval? (Yes)
5. ✅ **Images in Supabase**? (Yes)
6. ✅ **Separate URLs** for site and admin? (Recommended)

---
